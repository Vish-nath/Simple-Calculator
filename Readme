# Project Description: 

In this assignment, I created a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. The goal of this project is to develop a functional calculator that can perform
arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project
helped me practice your front-end development skills and enhance your understanding of web
technologies.
